Use Wireshark to view packets sent. Capture for `udp.port == 53`.

Use dig to make request for `dig @8.8.8.8 -p 53 www.google.com`.

You can see www.google.com embedded in the sent packet. You can see it
in the reply.

Where's the IP address? Examine the DIG output. And then convert to
hex like so:

    printf '%x\n' 172

You can also see this in wireshark.
